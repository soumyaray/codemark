# Introduction to R

The best way to learn R from scratch is by installing and running the [Swirl](https://swirlstats.com/students.html) tutorials in RStudio. Here, we review the most basic essentials to R.

Variables: R allows you to store data, values, and results of your analyses in variables. Here is an example of how to assign values to variables:

```{r}
value <- 5
construct_name <- "PO"
```

Collections: Multiple values can be defined and stored together. Vectors are collections of simple values (numbers, characters). Lists are collections of simple values or even other collections

```{r}
# Vector of five numbers
numbers <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

# Vector of characters (letters or numbers in quotes)
construct_names <- c("PO", "PI")

# List of values and vectors
construct_definition <- list(
  name = "Purchase Intention",
  items = c("pi_1", "pi_2", "pi_3", "pi_4"))
```

We can then extract what we have stored in these collections as we need them.

```{r}
construct_names[2]

construct_definition$items
```

Operations: Simple mathematical operations can be computed on values (numbers, words, etc.) or on variables. R is specially suited to performing operations on vectors (like our `numbers` from above).

```{r, }
5 * 2

numbers <- 1:5

numbers^2
```

Functions: Complex operations that require more information to compute are often packaged as functions. These function takes arguments and return results that can be stored in variables or displayed on screen. Note that comments (descriptive text that does not run) is prefixed with a pound sign ("#").

```{r}
# load data from a file into a variable using the "read.csv" function
influence_data <- read.csv("data/influencer_data_book_final.csv")

# run a regression analysis
influence_regr <- lm(formula = pi_1 ~ pq_1 + sic_1, data = influence_data)

# show a summary of results from the regression on screen
summary(influence_regr)

# save the summary to a variable for further inspection
regr_report <- summary(influence_regr)
```

Variables, like the regression report we are storing in `regr_report`, often contain a deeper structure of values that one can inspect:

```{r}
regr_report$r.squared
```

# Introduction SEM

Structural Equation Modeling excels at allowing researchers to measure relationships between multi-item constructs. *Constructs* are statistical representation of concepts that are hard to measure in with a singular metric, and are best represented by multiple measurements.

Each SEM is defined by two models: a **measurement model** that describes how each construct is measured using multiple items, and **structural model** that describes the structure of causal relationships between the constructs. The parameters of an SEM can then be **estimated** and **visualized** by the SEMinR package.

```{r echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
library(seminr)

influence_mm <- constructs(
  reflective("PL", multi_items("pl_", 1:4)),
  reflective("PQ", multi_items("pq_", 1:4)),
  reflective("PI", multi_items("pi_", 1:5)))

influence_sm <- relationships(
  paths(from = c("PL", "PQ"), to = c("PI")))

influence_model <- specify_model(influence_mm, influence_sm)
influence_model_plot <- plot(influence_model)
save_plot("figures/influencer_model_plot.png", influence_model_plot)
```
```{r simpleModel, fig.align = 'center', out.width = "50%", fig.cap = "Simplified Influencer Model", echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/influencer_model_plot.png")
```

# Measurement Model

We can define the measurement model of an SEM simply by describing each  construct by its set of *measurement items* that *reflect* the underlying concept. Let's see a simplified example from the Influencer model and dataset we will use:
```{r}
library(seminr)

influence_mm <- constructs(
  reflective("PL", multi_items("pl_", 1:4)),
  reflective("PQ", multi_items("pq_", 1:4)),
  reflective("PI", multi_items("pi_", 1:5)))
```

Four constructs are defined in this measurement model. Note how the constructs are collectively defined within the `constructs()` function. Each construct is defined as being reflected in their measurement items using the `reflective()` function. And the multiple items reflecting each construct are defined by the `multi_items()` function. **The syntax of our SEMinR package closely matches the vocabulary that researchers use to describe such models!**

# Structural Model

We can define the structural model of an SEM by specifying the *relationships* between the constructs â€” specifically, the causal paths *from* each construct *to* other constructs.
```{r}
influence_sm <- relationships(
  paths(from = c("PL", "PQ"), to = c("PI")))
```

Note that we can define a set of relationships at once. In the `paths()` function call above, we defines two paths, one from each of `PL` and `PQ` to each of `PI`.

# Data

Once we have the measurement and structural models of an SEM defined in SEMinR, we can proceed to estimate the measurement and structural parameters from a sample of data. The data should contain *observations* of each measurement item for each case (e.g., survey respondent). The data typically resides in a file with a data format such as `.csv` (comma separated variables), though there are R packages to load data in other formats such as `.sav` (SPSS data), `xlsx` (Excel data sheet), and so on.

```{r}
influence_data <- read.csv("data/influencer_data_book_final.csv")
```

# Estimation

We can use the data we have loaded to now estimate the parameters of our SEM. In this case, we use an estimate technique called *covariance-based SEM* (CB-SEM).

```{r}
influence_model <- estimate_cbsem(
  data = influence_data,
  measurement_model = influence_mm,
  structural_model  = influence_sm)
```

The `influence_model` object in which the estimation is stored does not contain a full report that researchers would be interested in. Instead, researchers will want to ask SEMinR to *summarize* the results cogently for interpretation.

```{r}
influence_summary <- summary(influence_model)
```

\newpage

The `influence_summary` object holds a wealth of other estimated values that researchers might wish to inspect or report. For example, researchers applying CB-SEM are typically interested in the quality of the estimation, including details of how well the SEM model *fits* the data (we show only a part of the full fit report below):

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
influence_summary$quality$fit
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
influence_summary$quality$fit$curated$ordinary
```

These fit metrics should be familiar to CB-SEM practitioners. The summary object can also be inspect for the estimated parameters of interest, such as the measurement quality:

```{r}
influence_summary$quality$reliability
```

And also the structural paths that researchers often hypothesize

```{r}
influence_summary$paths
```

\newpage

# Visualization

Researchers often find that it is helpful to get a high-level glimpse of their model description and results from a visualization.

```{r eval=FALSE}
plot(influence_model)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, results='hide', cache=TRUE}
png(filename = "figures/influence_estimated_plot.png", width = 900, height=600)
plot(influence_model)
dev.off()
```

```{r estimated_model, fig.align = 'center', out.width = "70%", fig.cap = "Visualization of Simplified Influencer Model", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/influence_estimated_plot.png")
```
